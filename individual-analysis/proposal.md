# Proposal for Individual Analysis
Author: Charlotte Maples

## Introduction
Music is one of the few things that can bring together people from around the world. Whether that be a shared enjoyment in some melody, or a feud between fans of rival artists. Though generally it is a very common interest, each person's music taste will vary between eachother and over time.
Everyone has certain preconceived notions about their music interests and listening habits. We may associate our favorite songs, albums, or artists with a certain genre, "vibe", or time period that others would not even consider.

## Research Question
### How does my music taste and music biases compare to others? 
More specifically, 
- **How does my perception of genres differ from classifications by MusicBrainz and Spotify?**
- **How has my music taste changed over the past five years, and how does this compare to overall music trends?**
- **Do I listen to more indie artists than major label artists, as I assume?**

## Hypothesis
I would consider myself mostly an enjoyer of indie music, particularly by Gen-Z artists. I believe my music tastes have generally stayed somewhat away from the trends at the time, but has started to include a lot more major label artists as of late.
Thus, I hypothesize that:
* My perception of genre classifications will not significantly differ from MusicBrainz or Spotify's classifications.
* My music taste has shifted more towards major label, but not necessarily mainstream, artists over the past few years.

## Methods
To explore these questions, I plan to:
* Compare my perceptions of genre classifications of my favorite songs to classifications from MetaBrainz and Spotify.
* Track how my music taste has changed using timestamps from my liked/saved songs. 
* Compare my music evolution with trends in popular music using MetaBrainz historical data.
* Use MetaBrainz label data to determine if my liked songs favor indie or major label artists.
